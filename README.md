# Prestance
## React-Native RSS App

Prestance is a free and open-source alternative to News Apps that steals your privacy :lock:  
Now, some (french) sources are already in the app, it will soon be possible to choose them at first launch :wink:

It's entirely built in React-Native! :pencil:  
Application under development, several features are not yet available now!  

### To-Do:
- Categories
- Languages
- Choose RSS source from drawer
- Settings
- Dark theme with button

Here's what it looks like right now :tada:
